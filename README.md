# Election Analysis
## Overview of Election Audit:
The Colorado Board of Election Commisson has requested an election audit of the election results for the US Congressional precinct in Colorado. The election commission has requested the following additional data to complete the audit:
  1) The voter turnout for each county
  2) The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
  3) The county with the highest turnout

Our goal: 
  - To generate a vote count report to certify the US congressional election
  - To automate the election audit process using Python, if done successfully the code we write will be used to audit other congressional districts, senetorial disctricts and local elections. 

## Election-Audit Results:
   - How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
      - 369,711 total votes were cast
